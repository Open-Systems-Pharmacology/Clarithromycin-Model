The PBPK model for clarithromycin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data. 

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous and oral administrations
* a dose range of 100 mg to 1200 mg
* single and multiple doses

The model quantifies metabolism via CYP3A4, including also the mechanism-based inhibition of the respective enzyme, as well as elimination via kidney. The model also includes inhibition of P-gp.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
