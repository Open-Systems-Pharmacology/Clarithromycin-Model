The general workflow for building an adult PBPK model has been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-References)). Relevant information on the anthropometry (height, weight) was gathered from the respective clinical study, if reported. Information on physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, hematocrit) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been incorporated in PK-Sim® as described previously ([Willmann 2007](#5-References)). The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available 'PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-References)).

A typical European individual was used for the development of the clarithromycin model. The relative tissue-specific expression of CYP3A4 was implemented in accordance with literature information using the PK-Sim expression database RT-PCR profile. Enterohepatic recirculation was enabled as it is active under physiological conditions. 

Unknown parameters (see [Section 2.3.4](#234-Automated-Parameter-Identification)) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®.

The model was then verified by simulating the PK of additional clinical studies including a dose range of 100 to 1200 mg administered as single dose or as multiple doses.

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#2.2	Data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#2.3 Model Parameters and Assumptions).
