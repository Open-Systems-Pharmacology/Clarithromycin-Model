### 2.2.2	Clinical Data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on clarithromycin in healthy adults. The clarithromycin model was developed using 17 clinical studies covering a dosing range from 100 to 1200 mg.

#### 2.2.2.1	Model Building

The following studies were used for model building (training data):

| Publication                | Arm / Treatment / Information used for model building        |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Chu 1992b](#5-References) | Healthy subjects with intravenous infusion of 250 mg over 45 min |
| [Chu 1993a](#5-References) | Healthy subjects with oral administration of 250 or 500 mg as single dose or twice daily for 5 days |

#### 2.2.2.2	Model Verification

The following studies were used for model verification (test data):

| Publication                         | Arm / Treatment / Information used for model building        |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
