Clarithromycin is a widely prescribed macrolide antibiotic and a substrate and mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A4. Furthermore, clarithromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp and an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 ([Eberl 2007](#5-references), [Seithel 2007](#5-references)). Clarithromycin has been proposed as one of the best alternative CYP3A4 inhibitors for clinical DDI studies to avoid further use of ketoconazole.

Objectives were to develop a fully mechanistic PBPK model for clarithromycin, describing its metabolism by CYP3A4 and its mechanism-based inactivation of the respective enzyme as well as its inhibition of P-gp.

The presented clarithromycin model was developed by Moj et al. ([Moj 2017](#5-references)) and revised by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2018](#5-references)).
